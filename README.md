To guess the random number by the factors of that number

The "Guess the Number" game implemented using HTML, Bootstrap, and JavaScript. It presents a simple user interface where the player can input their guess for a randomly generated number between 1 and 100. The game provides feedback on whether the guess is too high or too low and keeps track of the number of attempts made. Additionally, it displays the possible factors of the secret number to provide hints to the player. The game continues until the player correctly guesses the secret number, at which point it congratulates the player and displays the number of attempts it took to guess correctly.
